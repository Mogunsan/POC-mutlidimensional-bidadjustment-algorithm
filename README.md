The problem:

Bid adjustments in Google Adwords are multiplicative.
Assume a base bid of 1€. We set a bid adjustment of 50% for mobile users because they increase the value of these particular bids click by 0.50€. And another bid adjustment for bids that happen mondays by 20% (0.20€ value increase). The click is worth 1.70€ to us but the final bid will be 1€ ∗ 1.5 ∗ 1.2 = 1.80€. With large bid adjustments across multiple bid adjustment groups and dimensions this leads to overspend.
